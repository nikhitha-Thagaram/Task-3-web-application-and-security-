**Author:** Nikhitha Thagaram  
**Environment:** Kali Linux (Local VM)

**Security Level Used:** Low  
**PHP Version:** 8.4.11

## Overview

This repository contains my practical work for the Web Application Security Lab using DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application).  
The exercises cover:

- SQL Injection  
- Cross-Site Scripting (Stored & Reflected XSS)  
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)  
- File Inclusion (LFI with php://filter)  
- Burp Suite (Intercept + Intruder)  
- Web Security Headers  

## Contents
- **Report.md** → Detailed explanation of each vulnerability, payloads used, results & mitigation.  
- **notes/environment.md** → Environment details used for the lab.  
- **notes/video-script.txt** → Word-by-word script for the 8-minute demo video.

## How to View
1. Open **Report.md** to review the full documented steps.
2. Review **notes/video-script.txt** to see the demonstration walk-through.
3. Screenshots and local files are not uploaded for privacy/security.

## Important
This project is performed only on a local DVWA instance in a controlled lab environment.  
Do **NOT** attempt these attacks on real or production websites.
